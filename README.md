# Morphological Algorithms:

# Introduction:
This repository contain three .ipynb files coded with Python programation language (version 3.9.1), those algorithms are detailed in a report which is the .pdf file. The programmation part of this project is the part 5 of the report called "Computational Realisation and Tree Analysis". Few libraries where also used, numpy, matplotlib, random. These library where used with the last version disponible on the 11/01/2021.
The three algorithms are respectively;
  - The Combinatorics of Tree-Realizations Algorithm.
  - The Random Tree Generator.
  - The Persistent Entropy Quantifier.
And are disponible in the /src folder.

----------------------
Command Line Arguments
----------------------

There is no need of argument for the three algorithm, default barcodes are given in each three but if you want to use the algorithm with your own barcode you need to modify the source code and respect the structure described in the report.

Example:
  - ./The Combinatorics of Tree-Realizations Algorithm
  
-------------------------
Design Decisions & Issues
-------------------------
The algorithm are designed to run with predifined quantity of generation or anything that have for consequence increasing the running time of the algorithm. This can be changed manually but with the risk of having a slow execution.

--------------
Output example
--------------
Examples for each algorithm are disponible in the report, we really invite you to give a look.
